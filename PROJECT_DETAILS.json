	"description" : "Different data structures are utilized in the JavaScript to model the behaviors and constraints of the MBTI system. AngularJS then binds the user selections to those data structures to validate/process the selections. Uses jQuery mainly for accessing/modifying CSS classes on DOM elements. Uses CSS grid and media queries for responsiveness",
