What if they start with the preferences and there's 3 cards per row, and 1 row for each preference row on the chart
	Ex: I, E, Unsure

After completing that section, it'll reveal the functions section. Whatever guesses can be extrapolated about the functions from the preferences will have a DOTTED OUTLINE show up around the given function

The idea is that, in the end, all the user's selections should line up and they can help validate that visually

After making all their selections, they can hit a submit button or something and it'll validate the selections and highlight incompatible selections and try to define why they're in conflict with one another

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clicks I, E disables
clicks N, S disables
etc.

Clicks Si ("Primary" label shows up), Se disables, Ni disables, Ne ("Secondary" label shows up")
	Mirror this with the 2 judging functions

WAIT!! Make every choice propagate through the whole thing, so the whole system can be easily visualized
